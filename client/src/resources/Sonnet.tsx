Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
With my extern the outward honouring,
 Or laid great bases for eternity,
  Which proves more short than waste or ruining? Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour Lose all and more by paying too much rent For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
   Pitiful thrivers,

     And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
